The biggest threat to OpenAI isn't who you'd expect.

It's not Google. It's not Anthropic. According to their internal "Code Red" alert, it's the acceleration of open-source models and emerging AI labs.

Here's what this signals for the industry:

1. **The moat is shrinking.** When the leader feels threatened, it means the gap between proprietary and open solutions is closing faster than anyone predicted.

2. **Infrastructure is the new battleground.** AWS just committed $110M to AI-native startups building on their custom silicon. The real competition isn't models—it's compute access.

3. **Context Engineering > Prompt Engineering.** The next wave of AI effectiveness isn't about better prompts. It's about designing dynamic systems that provide the right information and tools at runtime. Static prompts are becoming a liability.

4. **Workforce restructuring is accelerating.** IBM's CEO warning about AI-driven job changes isn't speculation—it's planning. The question isn't whether knowledge work changes, but how fast.

The companies thriving won't be those with the best models. They'll be those who master the infrastructure layer and build systems that compose AI capabilities effectively.

What's your read on where the real AI competition is heading?
